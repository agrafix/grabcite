Most of the funds invested into the development of various MT systems have been wasted and have not stimulated a development of techniques which would allow to translate at least technical texts from a certain limited domain. There were, of course, exceptions, which demonstrated that under certain conditions it is possible to develop a system which will save money and efforts invested into human translation. The main reason why the field of MT has not met the expectations of sci-fi literature, but also the expectations of scientific community, is the complexity of the task itself. A successful automatic translation system requires an application of techniques from several areas of computational linguistics (morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse analysis etc.) as a necessary, but not a sufficient condition. The general opinion is that it is easier to create an MT system for a pair of related languages. In our contribution we would like to",

At the time when the work was terminated in 1990, the system had a main translation dictionary of about 8000 words, accompanied by so called transducing dictionary covering another 2000 words. The transducing dictionary was based on the original idea described in Kirschner (1987). It aimed at the exploitation of the fact that technical terms are based (in a majority of European languages) on Greek or Latin stems, adopted according to the particular derivational rules of the given languages. This fact allows for the \\\"translation\\\" of technical terms by means of a direct transcription of productive endings and a slight (regular) adjustment of the spelling of the stem. For example, the English words localization and discrimination can be transcribed into Czech as \\\"lokalizace\\\" and \\\"diskriminace\\\" with a productive ending -ation being transcribed to -ace. It was generally assumed that for the pair Czech\\/Russian the transducing dictionary would be able to profit from a substantially greater number of productive rules. This hypothesis proved to be wrong, too (see B6mov~, Kubofi (1990)). The set of productive endings for both pairs (English\\/Czech, as developed for an earlier MT system from English to Czech, and Czech\\/Russian) was very similar. The evaluation of results of RUSLAN showed that roughly 40% of input sentences were translated correctly, about 40% with minor errors correctable by a human post-editor and about 20% of the input required substantial editing or re-translation. There were two main factors that caused a deterioration of the translation. The first factor was the incompleteness of the main dictionary of the system. Even though the system contained a set of so-called fail-soft rules, whose task was to handle such situations, an unknown word typically caused a failure of the module of syntactic analysis, because the dictionary entries contained - besides the translation equivalents and morphological information - very important syntactic information. The second factor was the module of syntactic analysis of Czech. There were several reasons of parsing failures. Apart from the common inability of most rule-based formal grammars to cover a particular natural language to the finest detail of its syntax there were other problems. One of them was the existence of non-projective constructions, which are quite common in Czech even in relatively short sentences. Even though they account only for 1.7\\u00B0\\/'o of syntactic dependencies, every third Czech sentence contains at least one, and in a news corpus, we discovered as much as 15 non-projective dependencies; see also Haji6 et al. (1998). An example of a non-projective construction is \\\"Soubor se nepodafilo otev~it.\\\" [lit.: File Refl. was_not._possible to_open. - It was not possible to open the file]. The formalism used for the implementation (Q-systems) was not meant to handle non-projective constructions. Another source of trouble was the use of so-called semantic features. These features were based on lexical semantics of individual words. Their main task was to support a semantically plausible analysis and to block the implausible ones. It turned out that the question of implausible combinations of semantic features is also more complex than it was supposed to be. The practical outcome of the use of semantic features was a higher ratio of parsing failures - semantic features often blocked a plausible analysis. For example, human lexicographers assigned the verb 'to run' a semantic feature stating that only a noun with semantic features of a human or other living being may be assigned the role of subject of this verb. The input text was however full of sentences with 'programs' or 'systems' running etc. It was of course very easy to correct the semantic feature in the dictionary, but the problem was that there were far too many corrections required. On the other hand, the fact that both languages allow a high degree of word-order freedom accounted for a certain simplification of the translation process. The grammar relied on the fact that there are only minor word-order differences between Czech and Russian. 1.3 Lessons learned from RUSLAN We have learned several lessons regarding the MT of closely related languages: \\u2022 The transfer-based approach provides a similar quality of translation both for closely related and typologically different languages \\u2022 Two main bottlenecks of full-fledged transfer-based systems are:",

The amounts of texts being localized are huge and the localization costs are huge as well. It is quite clear that the localization from one source language to several target languages, which are typologically similar, but different from the source language, is a waste of money and effort. It is of course much easier to translate texts from Czech to Polish or from Russian to Bulgarian than from English or German to any of these languages. There are several reasons, why localization and translation is not being performed through some pivot language, representing a certain group of closely related languages. Apart from political reasons the translation through a pivot language has several drawbacks. The most important one is the problem of the loss of translation quality. Each translation may to a certain extent shift the meaning of the translated text and thus each subsequent translation provides results more and more different from the original. The second most important reason is the lack of translators from the pivot to the target language, while this is usually no problem for the translation from the source directly to the target language.",

When a human translator starts translating a new sentence, the system tries to match the source with sentences already stored in the translation memory. If it is successful, it suggests the translation and the human translator decides whether to use it, to modify it or to reject it. The segmentation of a translation memory is a key feature for our system. The translation memory may be exported into a text file and thus allows easy manipulation with its content. Let us suppose that we have at our disposal two translation memories - one human made for the source\\/pivot language pair and the other created by an MT system for the pivot\\/target language pair. The substitution of segments of a pivot language by the segments of a target language is then only a routine procedure. The human translator translating from the source language to the target language then gets a translation memory for the required pair (source\\/target). The system of penalties applied in TRADOS Translator's Workbench (or a similar system) guarantees that if there is already a human-made translation present, then it gets higher priority than the translation obtained as a result of the automatic MT. This system solves both problems mentioned above the human translators from the pivot to the target language are not needed at all and the machine-made translation memory serves only as a resource supporting the direct human translation from the source to the target language.",

It was clear that application of a similar method to that one used in the system RUSLAN would lead to similar results. Due to the closeness of both languages we have decided to apply a simpler method. Our new system, (~ESILKO, aims at a maximal exploitation of the similarity of both languages. The system uses the method of direct word-for-word translation, justified by the similarity of syntactic constructions of both languages. Although the system is currently being tested on texts from the domain of documentation to corporate information systems, it is not limited to any specific domain. Its primary task is, however, to provide support for translation and localization of various technical texts.",

The type of ambiguity is slightly different in languages with a rich inflection (majority of Slavic languages) and in languages which do not have such a wide variety of forms derived from a single lemma. For example, in Czech there are only rare cases of part-of-speech ambiguities (st~t [to stay\\/the state], zena [woman\\/chasing] or tri [three\\/rub(imperative)]), much more frequent is the ambiguity of gender, number and case (for example, the form of the adjective jam[ [spring] is 27-times ambiguous). The main problem is that even though several Slavic languages have the same property as Czech, the ambiguity is not preserved. It is distributed in a different manner and the \\\"form-for-form\\\" translation is not applicable. Without the analysis of at least nominal groups it is often very difficult to solve this problem, because for example the actual morphemic categories of adjectives are in Czech distinguishable only on the basis of gender, number and case agreement between an adjective",

It gets an average number of 3.58 tags per token (word form in text) as an input. The tagging system is purely statistical, and it uses a log-linear model of probability distribution - see Haji~, Hladkfi (1998). The learning is based on a manually tagged corpus of Czech texts (mostly from the general newspaper domain). The system learns contextual rules (features) automatically and also automatically determines feature weights. The average accuracy of tagging is between 91 and 93% and remains the same even for technical texts (if we disregard the unknown names and foreign-language terms that are not ambiguous anyway). The lemmatization immediately follows tagging; it chooses the first lemma with a possible tag corresponding to the tag selected. Despite this simple lemmatization method, and also thanks to the fact that Czech words are rarely ambiguous in their Part-of-speech, it works with an accuracy exceeding 98%.",

For the evaluation of our system we have exploited the close connection between our system and the TRADOS Translator's Workbench. The method is simple - the human translator receives the translation memory created by our system and translates the text using this memory. The translator is free to make any changes to the text proposed by the translation memory. The target text created by a human translator is then compared with the text created by the mechanical application of translation memory to the source text. TRADOS then evaluates the percentage of matching in the same manner as it normally evaluates the percentage of matching of source text with sentences in translation memory. Our system achieved about 90% match (as defined by the TRADOS match module) with the results of human translation, based on a relatively large (more than 10,000 words) test sample.",
