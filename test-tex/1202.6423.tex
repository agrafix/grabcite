We present a square root limit on the information rate with low probability of detection (LPD) over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Specifically, if the transmitter has AWGN channels to a receiver and a warden, both with non-zero noise power, we prove that $o(\sqrt{n})$ bits can be sent from the transmitter to the receiver in $n$ channel uses while lower-bounding the warden's probability of detection error by $1-\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$. Moreover, in most practical scenarios, a lower bound on the noise power on the warden's channel to the transmitter is known and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits can be covertly sent in $n$ channel uses. Conversely, attempting to transmit more than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits either results in detection by the warden with probability one or a non-zero probability of decoding error as $n\rightarrow\infty$. %Further, we show that LPD communication on the AWGN channel allows one to send a non-zero symbol on \emph{every} channel use, in contrast to what might be expected from the square root law found recently in image-based steganography.
